            "description": "The dataset derives from the Seattle Alzheimer’s Disease Brain Cell Atlas (SEA-AD), which curated a prospective, longitudinally characterised donor cohort deliberately spanning the full continuum of Alzheimer’s pathology. The dataset primarily has labels consisting of donor-ids, biological + spatial markers and metadata fields including Braak stage, Thal phase, CERAD score, dementia diagnosis, APOE genotype, Cognitive Status, and Overall AD neuropathological change. \n\nDetails on biological & spatial markers are attached here. Each QND data entry encodes What (biomarker) × Where (grey matter / cortical layers) × How (area %, count, density, size, co-expression, etc.). All the QND data in this dataset is a permutation over these three axes.\n\nWhat (Biomarkers):\n- AT8 (pTau) – hyper-phosphorylated tau → core neurofibrillary tangles of AD.\n- pTDP-43 – phosphorylated TDP-43 → limbic co-pathology that speeds cognitive decline.\n- 6E10 (Aβ 1-16) – amyloid-β plaque antibody → canonical early and late Aβ burden.\n- aSyn (α-synuclein) – mis-folded α-syn aggregates → Lewy-body co-pathology.\n- Iba1 – microglial marker → innate immune activation indexed by morphology.\n- GFAP – astrocytic intermediate filaments → reactive gliosis in late-stage injury.\n- NeuN – neuronal nuclear protein → census of surviving neurons / loss.\n- Hematoxylin – universal nuclear counter-stain → baseline tissue cellularity and QC.\n\nWhere (anatomical bins):\n- Grey matter – the entire middle-temporal cortical ribbon, used as a global reference.\n- Layers 1–4 – individual laminar bins capturing the radial gradient of pathology (L1 = molecular, L2 = external granule, L3 = external pyramidal, L4 = internal granule).\n- Layers 5-6 – deep output layers quantified together because the image pipeline cannot always separate them cleanly.\n\n\nHow (measurement affixes):\ntotal … positive area – raw immunoreactive area (µm²).\npercent … positive area – fraction of the analyzed bin that is positive (%).\nnumber of … positive cells/objects – count of labeled cells or plaques.\n… per area – density normalized to tissue sampled (count · mm⁻²).\naverage … positive cell/object area – mean size of each labeled entity (µm²).\nco-expression / co-localised objects – spatial overlap between two markers (e.g. AT8 + pTDP-43).\nprocess area / process length (Iba1 only) – microglial branching metrics, a proxy for activation.\narea analysed – denominator tissue area (µm²) for QC and normalization.\nripa … / guhcl … – biochemical ELISA loads of soluble (RIPA) versus insoluble (guanidine) protein fractions (pg · mg⁻¹ tissue).",
