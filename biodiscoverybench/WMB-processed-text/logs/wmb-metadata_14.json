GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\\n   - The dataset contains detailed information on 490,232 mouse brain cells.\\n   - Columns related to cell types include cell type classifications, spatial coordinates, neurotransmitter types, and visualization color codes.\\n   - The dataset description includes information about regions of interest within the brain, likely to include cortical regions.\\n   - The dataset captures classifications at various levels, including class, subclass, and supertype classifications.\\n\\n2. FACTS TO DERIVE\\n   - The specific subclasses of neurons that are exclusively found in cortical regions.\\n   - Identification of the cortical regions using the columns available in the dataset, specifically through the 'region_of_interest_acronym' or other related columns.\\n   - A logical deduction of what \\\"exclusively\\\" means in this context, potentially implying that a certain subclass does not appear in other non-cortical regions in the dataset.\\n\\n3. EDUCATED GUESSES OR TO BE LOOKED UP FACTS\\n   - The meaning of specific acronyms or labels for \\\"cortical\\\" regions in the 'region_of_interest_acronym' column, unless explicitly available in the dataset.\\n   - The relationship between the neurotransmitter types and the subclasses, which might provide clues about which neurons to focus on.\\n   - Common knowledge about cortical neuron subclasses that may guide analysis but would need confirmation via the dataset.\\n\\n\\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\\n\\n1. Load the dataset `data/cell_subsampled.csv` to ensure the necessary data is available for analysis. Focus on key columns such as `region_of_interest_acronym`, `subclass`, `x`, `y`, and others relevant to the task.\\n\\n2. Explore the dataset to identify which regions are explicitly labeled as cortical within the `region_of_interest_acronym` column, defining what constitutes \\\"cortical regions.\\\"\\n\\n3. Filter the dataset to separate neurons found within the identified cortical regions from those present in other regions.\\n\\n4. Analyze the `subclass` column for neurons in the cortical regions to identify subclasses that are exclusively present there.\\n\\n5. Verify the exclusivity of each identified subclass by checking their absence in non-cortical regions within the dataset.\\n\\n6. Formulate a scientific hypothesis based on the findings, discussing the biological significance of discovering neuron subclasses that are exclusive to cortical regions.\\n\\n7. Create a workflow summary detailing each step undertaken, from data loading through final analysis and hypothesis formulation.\\n\""}
