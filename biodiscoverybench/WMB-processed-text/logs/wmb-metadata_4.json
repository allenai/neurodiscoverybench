GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\\n- The dataset contains information related to 490,232 mouse brain cells with specific columns like cell type classifications, spatial coordinates, neurotransmitter types, and visualization color codes.\\n- The subclass \\u201c018 L2 IT PPP-APr Glut\\u201d is specifically mentioned in the query, and the question asks about the prevalence of certain clusters within this subclass in specific library labels.\\n- The dataset columns relevant to such an analysis include `cluster_alias`, `library_label`, and `subclass`.\\n\\n2. FACTS TO DERIVE\\n- Determine which specific clusters belong to the subclass \\u201c018 L2 IT PPP-APr Glut\\u201d in the dataset.\\n- Assess the proportion or count of these clusters across different `library_label`s to identify any patterns of prevalence.\\n- Possibly compute statistical significance to determine if there is a meaningful distribution difference among `library_label`s for these clusters.\\n\\n3. EDUCATED GUESSES OR TO BE LOOKED UP FACTS\\n- Statistical methods, such as chi-square tests, might be necessary to evaluate the prevalence's statistical significance among library labels.\\n- The size of the sample or clusters necessary to reach a statistically significant result might be dependent on further analysis of the dataset.\\n- Understanding typical practices in spatial transcriptomics and sequencing library preparations might provide context regarding any observed discrepancies among clusters or labels.\\n\\n\\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\\n\\n1. Load the dataset `data/cell_subsampled.csv`.\\n\\n2. Filter the dataset to include only rows where the `subclass` is \\u201c018 L2 IT PPP-APr Glut\\u201d.\\n\\n3. Identify all unique clusters within the filtered dataset by examining the `cluster_alias` or `cluster` column.\\n\\n4. Calculate the distribution (count and/or proportion) of these clusters across different `library_label`s to evaluate prevalence.\\n\\n5. Perform statistical analysis to determine if there is a significant association between clusters and `library_labels`. This might involve using chi-square tests or other suitable statistical methods.\\n\\n6. Interpret the results to form a hypothesis about the prevalence of specific clusters in relation to `library_labels`.\\n\\n7. Summarize the workflow and findings in a WORKFLOW SUMMARY and prepare a scientific hypothesis based on the analysis.\\n\""}

Each row will represent a cluster, and each column represents a library label.\\n\\n2. **Conduct the Chi-Square Test**:\\n   - Make sure to import the library that will allow you to perform the necessary statistical analysis:\\n     ```python\\n     from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency\\n     ```\\n   - Execute the chi-square test using:\\n     ```python\\n     chi2, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(contingency_table)\\n     ```\\n   - `chi2` is the test statistic, `p` is the p-value, `dof` is the degrees of freedom, and `expected` are the expected counts if no association exists.\\n\\n3. **Interpret the Results**:\\n   - **P-Value**: Evaluate the p-value result.

Conversely, a non-significant result would mean that the distribution of clusters across library labels does not show pattern dependency, supporting the null hypothesis of independence.\\n\\nFor exact instructions or help step-by-step as you use the particular software or environment, please let me know.
