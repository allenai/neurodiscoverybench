GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\\n   - The dataset contains information on 490,232 mouse brain cells.\\n   - Two of the columns in the dataset are related to neurotransmitter type: `neurotransmitter`.\\n   - The dataset description includes classifications such as class, subclass, and supertype of cells.\\n   - The core query is about identifying how many subclasses co-express dopamine and glutamate neurotransmitters.\\n\\n2. FACTS TO DERIVE\\n   - The specific subclasses that co-express both dopamine and glutamate.\\n   - Whether neurotransmitter expression is exclusive to one type per cell or whether cells can express multiple neurotransmitters.\\n   - Aggregation or filtering logic to determine how subclasses are counted in terms of particular neurotransmitter expressions.\\n\\n3. EDUCATED GUESSES OR TO BE LOOKED UP FACTS\\n   - The potential expression patterns and biological plausibility of co-expression of dopamine and glutamate in the same cell or subclass.\\n   - Typically, individual neurons might express a primary neurotransmitter, but it's worth exploring if there is literature or data supporting co-expression in this context.\\n\\n\\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\\n\\n1. Load the dataset `data/cell_subsampled.csv` to understand its structure and contents fully.\\n\\n2. Explore the dataset to inspect the relevant columns, particularly focusing on `neurotransmitter` and `subclass`.\\n\\n3. Identify entries where the neurotransmitter column indicates the expression of both dopamine and glutamate.\\n\\n4. Determine the specific subclasses that are associated with these co-expressed neurotransmitters.\\n\\n5. Calculate the number of unique subclasses that co-express both dopamine and glutamate.\\n\\n6. Develop a scientific hypothesis based on the findings from the dataset and the biological insights they provide.\\n\\n7.
