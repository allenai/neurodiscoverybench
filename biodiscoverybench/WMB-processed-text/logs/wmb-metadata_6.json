This is based on the statistical evidence provided by the chi-squared test, which resulted in a chi-squared statistic of approximately 13,172,932.24 with a p-value of 0.0, indicating a statistically significant association between donor labels and cluster distributions.\\n\\n**WORKFLOW SUMMARY:**\\n\\n1. **Data Loading:** The dataset `data/cell_subsampled.csv` was loaded successfully, containing relevant columns like `donor_label`, `cluster`, and others describing cell characteristics.\\n   \\n2. **Data Exploration:** The dataset was examined to understand its structure and the unique donor labels and clusters present.\\n\\n3. **Distribution Exploration:** The distribution of cell clusters for each donor label was explored by grouping the data based on donor labels and clustering assignments, which allowed for an assessment of cluster diversity across different donors.\\n\\n4. **Statistical Analysis:** A chi-squared test was performed to evaluate whether the observed distribution differences among donor labels were statistically significant. The outcome was a highly significant chi-squared statistic and a p-value of 0.0.\\n\\n5. **Interpretation:** The significant statistics suggest that the distribution of clusters is not randomly distributed across donor labels but is associated with them.
