Make sure enough and correct analyses are performed to answer the user's question and reach to a conclusion before finishing the task.\\n2. Make sure the data was correctly loaded and the analysis was performed on the correct data.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo answer this REQUEST we have assembled the following team:\\n\\nuser: Responsible for passing user message to the chat.\\nplanner: An agent that helps with decomposing a high-level plan.\\nprogrammer: An agent that helps with programming tasks.\\ndata_expert: An agent that helps with data inference tasks with provided data/results.\\n\\n\\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\\n\\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\\n   - The dataset named `data/cell_subsampled.csv` contains detailed information on mouse brain cells, with attributes like cell type classifications, spatial coordinates, neurotransmitter types, visualization color codes, among others.\\n   - The dataset includes a column `subclass` which can be used to determine subclasses of cells.\\n   - The `region_of_interest_acronym` column identifies specific brain regions including RHP.\\n   - The task is to identify which subclasses of GABAergic neurons are predominantly found in the RHP region of the mouse brain.\\n\\n2. FACTS TO DERIVE\\n   - Determine which entries in the dataset correspond to GABAergic neurons.\\n   - Identify and count the subclasses of these GABAergic neurons in the RHP region to determine those that are predominant.\\n   - Establish statistical significance if needed to determine predominance of certain subclasses over others.\\n\\n3. EDUCATED GUESSES OR TO BE LOOKED UP FACTS\\n   - \\\"GABAergic\\\" typically refers to neurons that use gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a neurotransmitter. This information will need to be derived from the dataset, likely using the `neurotransmitter` column.\\n   - The definition and scope of \\\"predominantly found\\\" may involve comparing counts of neuron subclasses in the RHP region, which will either be a direct statistical majority or determined through specific statistical tests for significance.\\n\\n\\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\\n\\n1. Load the dataset `data/cell_subsampled.csv` to begin analysis.\\n\\n2. Filter the dataset to select only the entries corresponding to GABAergic neurons. This can be accomplished by utilizing the `neurotransmitter` column to identify entries with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as the neurotransmitter type.\\n\\n3. From this filtered data, further refine the dataset to include only those rows where the `region_of_interest_acronym` is designated as RHP.\\n\\n4. Analyze the `subclass` column among the remaining entries to identify the different subclasses of GABAergic neurons present in the RHP region.\\n\\n5. Count the number of occurrences of each subclass within the RHP region to determine which subclasses are predominant.\\n\\n6. If necessary, conduct additional statistical analysis to confirm the predominance of specific subclasses by establishing statistical significance.\\n\\n7. Formulate a scientific hypothesis based on the identified findings in a natural language, providing context and detailing the relationships between relevant variables.\\n\\n8. Create a summary of the workflow, from data loading to the derivation of the final answer, documenting each step taken, decisions made, and the conclusions reached in addressing the original REQUEST.\\n\""}
