Specifically, genotypes such as '3/4', '4/4', and possibly '2/4' indicate the presence of an APOE4 allele.\\n   - From the first few rows, the presence of '3/4' in the \\\"APOE Genotype\\\" column indeed confirms the occurrence of the APOE4 allele.\\n\\n2. **Determine Its Frequency**:\\n   - To calculate the frequency of the APOE4 allele, count the occurrences of any genotype that includes '4' in the dataset, divided by the total number of entries.\\n\\n### Correlation with ADNC Scores:\\n\\n3. **ADNC Scores**:\\n   - The \\\"Overall AD neuropathological Change\\\" column is categorized into 'Not AD', 'Low', 'Intermediate', or 'High'.\\n   - Each level can be assigned a numerical value for correlation analysis (e.g., Not AD = 0, Low = 1, Intermediate = 2, High = 3).\\n\\n4. **Frequency Calculation**:\\n   - Group the data by the \\\"Overall AD neuropathological Change\\\" categories and calculate the percentage of '4' alleles within each group.\\n\\n5. **Correlation Analysis**:\\n   - Perform a statistical correlation analysis using methods such as Pearson's or Spearman's correlation to understand if there's a direct relationship between the frequency of APOE4 presence and ADNC scores.\\n\\n### Hypothesis and Statistical Significance:\\n\\n#### Hypothesis:\\nThe hypothesis is that the frequency of the APOE4 allele increases with higher levels of ADNC scores. This hypothesis is built upon the known association of the APOE4 allele with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease which might also reflect in neuropathological assessments.\\n\\n#### Statistical Significance:\\nDepending on the results of the correlation analysis, we will determine whether the correlation is statistically significant. A significant p-value in the analysis will support the hypothesis.\\n\\nThis analysis framework lays the foundation to investigate the relationship and verify whether the presence of APOE4 correlates with increasing Alzheimer's disease neuropathological changes.

FACTS TO DERIVE\\n- The frequency of the APOE4 allele needs to be determined from the dataset, particularly identifying genotypes like '3/4', '4/4'.\\n- Ensure the correlation between the frequency of the APOE4 allele and increasing ADNC (Alzheimer's Disease Neuropathological Change) scores is executable without data inconsistencies.\\n\\n3. EDUCATED GUESSES OR TO BE LOOKED UP FACTS\\n- Missing values, incorrect data types, or lack of variability in the dataset could be the cause of NaN results in the correlation analysis.\\n- The APOE4 allele is known to be associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that higher ADNC scores might correlate with APOE4 presence.\\n- Statistical methods such as Spearman correlation are appropriate given the ordinal nature of ADNC scores; however, proper pre-processing of data is crucial.\\n- The dataset likely requires careful verification of data integrity and appropriate encoding of variables before performing statistical tests.\\n\\nBy revisiting these aspects, we aim to solve the issues leading to NaN results, thus facilitating a meaningful analysis of the APOE4 allele's influence on Alzheimer's disease severity as represented in ADNC scores.\\n\\n\\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\\n\\n### Root Cause of the Failure:\\nThe primary issue leading to the NaN results in the Spearman correlation analysis was likely due to missing values, incorrect data types, or insufficient variability in the dataset regarding APOE4 allele presence and ADNC scores.

Additionally, both columns are appropriately typed as objects. The 'Overall AD neuropathological Change' has four categories: 'Not AD', 'Low', 'Intermediate', and 'High'.\\n\\nThe task now is to calculate the frequency of the APOE4 allele across different categories of ADNC scores defined under 'Overall AD neuropathological Change'. To do this, genotypes containing '3/4' and '4/4' should be identified as indicating the presence of the APOE4 allele.\\n\\nHere are the steps:\\n\\n1. **Frequency Calculation**: \\n   - Determine the number of donors carrying the APOE4 allele in each ADNC category ('Not AD', 'Low', 'Intermediate', 'High').\\n   - Calculate the frequency as the proportion of donors with APOE4 over the total number of donors in each ADNC category.\\n\\n2. **Spearman Correlation Analysis**:\\n   - Conduct a Spearman correlation analysis to assess the relationship between the APOE4 allele frequency and the categories of ADNC.\\n   - Note that 'Overall AD neuropathological Change' should be encoded numerically: 'Not AD' (1), 'Low' (2), 'Intermediate' (3), 'High' (4) for the analysis.\\n   \\nThe inference expected from the correlation analysis is whether there's a statistically significant relationship between increased presence of APOE4 and higher ADNC scores.\\n\\n**Insight**: If a positive and statistically significant Spearman correlation coefficient is found, it would suggest a potential association between the presence of the APOE4 allele and increased neuropathological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease.\\n\\n### Hypothesis Formulation\\n\\n**Scientific Hypothesis**: The frequency of the APOE4 allele is positively associated with greater severity of Alzheimer's Disease Neuropathological Changes, as indicated by higher ADNC scores.\\n\\n### Workflow Summary\\n\\n**WORKFLOW SUMMARY**:\\n1. **Data Inspection**: Checked the dataset for missing values and data type inconsistencies in critical columns.

The frequencies were as follows: \\n   - 'High': 47.62%\\n   - 'Intermediate': 23.81%\\n   - 'Low' and 'Not AD': 0%\\n\\n3. **Spearman Correlation Analysis**: The analysis provided a Spearman correlation coefficient of approximately -0.9487 with a p-value of approximately 0.0513. This negative correlation suggests that, within this dataset, there was not a significant relationship between the presence of the APOE4 allele and higher ADNC scores.\\n\\n**Scientific Hypothesis**:\\nThe initial hypothesis was that the frequency of the APOE4 allele might be associated with greater severity of Alzheimer's Disease Neuropathological Changes, represented by higher ADNC scores.
