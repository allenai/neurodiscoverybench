# 🧬 NeuroDiscoveryBench

NeuroDiscoveryBench is benchmark to evaluate AI agents on their ability to generate and verify scientific insights using biological datasets from the Allen Institute spanning neuroscience, genetics, and immunology. 

It consists of landmark papers from the Allen Institute including:
